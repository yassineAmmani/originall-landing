        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Our mission is to bring you original products where craftsmanship exceeds two-thirds of the process, ensuring each item is truly one-of-a-kind. We define "original products" as those in which more than two-thirds of the production process involves meticulous handcrafting, or items that are inherently unique, even when crafted by the same artisan.
